phase: alpha
description: |
  Meshnets are highly distributed, redundant intranet networks. A series of
  nodes, usually fashioned from cannibalized routers, emit signals that create
  a free self-contained and self-reliant network thatâ€™s accessible to any
  internet capable devices within range. We are dedicated to the growth of
  free-to-use wireless Internet access in Toronto's public and publicly
  accessible spaces.
