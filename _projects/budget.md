title: Toronto Budget Project
---
The mission of the Toronto Budget Project is to support informed debate
about the Toronto budget. The gitub planning repository for the project
is [here][repo-planning], and the wiki, with planning material, is
[here][wiki]. The github code repositories are [here][repo-front] and
[here][repo-back], and the trello project management board is
[here][trello]. The projectâ€™s GDrive folder is [here][gdrive]. If you
want to help, contact the current lead, Henrik Bechmann, at
<henrik@civictech.ca>.

As of December 2015, the Toronto Budget Workgroup has agreed on
implementing a website portal, including an interactive budget roadmap,
an interactive deputation helper, and an interactive budget explorer
(including data visualizations, and more). Hopefully these will take no
more than 80 person days, and be completed by next fall (2016).

The Workgroup is collaborating with [Better Budget TO][betterbudget] on
this project.
