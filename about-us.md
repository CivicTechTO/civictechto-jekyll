### Code of Conduct and Anti-harassment Policy

It's important that all participants are aware of the expectations and our culture, so we've put together a Code of Conduct for your review and as a reminder of the unwritten rules of generally being a good, kind and supportive human being and team player.

These are adapted from the [Recurse Center's Social Rules][recurse-rules], and the [anti-harassment policy from the Geek Feminism Wiki][geek-fem-wiki].

Civic Tech Toronto is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion or technical skill level. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate any time, including in present. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or asked to leave, at the discretion of the organizers.

Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from events and online forums.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the organizing team immediately.

Organizers will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your participation.
