On June 6, 2015, a group of engaged citizens came together to participate in Civic Tech Torontoâ€™s first hackday. Over 30 people from a wide variety of backgrounds, came together to hack on civic/social problems affecting our neighbourhoods and communities. The event was a great success! Some of the outcomes included:

* Discussion and creation of great civic ideas
* Communal motivation to push the civic technology movement forward
* Strong interest to create safe space for everyone to learn and practice civic tech via weekly hack nights 

Based on the feedback we received from our \*beta hackday, Civic Tech Toronto will be keeping the momentum going by launching a weekly hacknight model. Our first hacknight will be on Tuesday, July 21st 2015. We are super excited to create a space where Torontonians can engage in thoughtful discussion, come up with awesome city-building ideas, and bring their ideas to life to create meaningful impact in their communities. Hope to see you there!
