The Toronto budget is confusing, but it doesn’t need to be. Civic Tech Toronto’s *Toronto Budget Workgroup* in collaboration with [BetterBudgetTO][] is rethinking how citizens debate, research and demystify the annual City of Toronto budget. We’ve got some solid ideas that require your invaluable input, but you have to show up to find out what they are, and add your own!

**Session objectives:**

Brainstorm what information you need to help you better understand Toronto’s budget process

Help us assess the relevance of our existing proposed ideas

Identify most important ideas to you, for us to pursue next

Please join us for a fun, fast and furious brainstorming session on [Tuesday, November 10 from 6:30-9pm][event] at Lighthouse Labs (Queen & Bathurst) featuring:

* Free pizza!
* Fun ideation exercises!
* Friendly competition and surprises!

[RSVP to join the fun.](http://www.meetup.com/Civic-Tech-Toronto/events/225760065/) See you on November 10!

Yours,

Civic Tech Toronto
